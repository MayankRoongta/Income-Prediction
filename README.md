# Income-Prediction

Our work aims to predict whether the income of U.S. population exceeds $50K/yr
or not based on census data provided by Census bureau database, while
considering different factors such as age, work class, gender, marital status,
education, race, occupation etc. using exploratory analysis and classification
algorithms. The dataset contains 32561 records. The dataset encourages to draw
valuable insights and conclusions. The conclusions drawn might help in delivering
wiser decisions. In addition to it, suggestions could be given based on the
predictions to students who are in need to pursue higher education and people who
are spending less time in the workplace. We also aim to measure the accuracy of
different models using Logistic Regression, KNN classifier and Random Forest.
For the final output, the result of all the models will be considered.
